## Game Objective

Impress your bro by filling up the brometer. You score points with your performance on the activities (minigames). But you only have 7 days to do it! Try your best! ;) 

## How to Play

You start out in your man cave (bedroom). From there you must fill your schedule for the day from three activities:

* Eating
* Posing
* Boxing

Each activity has different effects on your three core stats: cash, manliness and willpower.

If you do a good job on the activities you earn brometer points to impress your Bro!

### Eating Minigame

Use the arrow keys (left and right) to get the most pancakes as you can.

### Posing Minigame

Try to remember the sequence and follow your Bro instructions to get the pose right!

### Boxing Minigame

Hit the punching bag with the left and right fists controlled by the arrow keys. Follow your Bro instructions to score hit combos to fill your brometer.
